# multiplicador-constante
generator of pseudorandom numbers 
# HOW DOES IT WORK?

It is an algorithm of pseudo-random numbers, it is used, for example, in card video games so that the player obtains cards randomly, it is also usually used in gambling games in general, to roll dice and that the value is different each time, it is a very useful algorithm although it is not the only algorithm capable of generating pseudo-random numbers

### It receives three entries of values:
- Seed: an initial value that must be of length May to three, for example 363
- Constant: a value with the same length as the seed, if the seed is of length 3 the constant must be the same size
- N: the number of times you want it to generate a pseudo-random number, if you enter 5 it will return 5 pseudo-random numbers, that is, it is the number of iterations you want to perform

If you want to know the algorithm in depth, I invite you to review the following [Prezi](https://prezi.com/ocwnu9wehquy/metodo-de-multiplicador-constante/)
